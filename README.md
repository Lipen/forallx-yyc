## Make PDFs Yourself

Clone the repository locally or download the ZIP file and run [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) on one of

  - `latexyyc.tex` (in color, for screen reading)
  - `latexyyc-print.tex` (b/w, for printing on Quarto stock)
  - `latexyyc-letter.tex` (b/w, for printing on regular letter-size paper)

You'll have to run `makeglossaries` to produce the glossary as well.

To make changes to the definitions in the preamble and `forallyyc.sty`
file, put them in a file named `forallxyyc-local.sty`. For instance,
to get the connectives to be & for and and horseshoe for the
conditional, copy `forallxyyc-local-sample.sty` to that file.
